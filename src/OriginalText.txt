Today is the anniversary of the publication of Robert Frost iconic poem Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favour fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.
Of course poetic mastermind Robert Frost was going to make his way onto this list. Interestingly, this 1920 poem was penned just two years after WWI.
In the space of nine lines, and with the aid of some vivid juxtaposition,
Frost perfectly captures that post-war uncertainty and existential aches that many would have felt during this time.
