Today is the anniversary of the publication of Robert Frost iconic poem Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
Some say the world will end in fireF
Some say in iceH
From what Iá¿¿ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favour fireH
But if it had to perish twiceF
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would sufficeH
Of course poetic mastermind Robert Frost was going to make his way onto this listH InterestinglyF this KSLJ poem was penned just two years after WWIH
In the space of nine linesF and with the aid of some vivid juxtapositionF
Frost perfectly captures that postGwar uncertainty and existential aches that many would have felt during this timeH
